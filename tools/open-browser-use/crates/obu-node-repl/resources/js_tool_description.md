Execute JavaScript in a persistent Node-backed open-browser-use kernel. Each call
runs as a fresh ES module in the same Node child; top-level `let`/`const` bindings
from successful calls carry forward, so define helpers once and reuse them later.
Reach for it when a task benefits from JavaScript state, top-level `await`, module
imports, filesystem inspection, data shaping, or repeated probing. `js_reset`
clears that state by respawning the child and refreshing runtime browser descriptors.

This `js` tool **is** the entire browser-automation surface — do not ask for
separate `click`, `type`, `screenshot`, or `scroll` tools; drive the browser by
writing JavaScript with `agent`, `tab`, `locator`, `tab.dom_cua`, and `tab.cua`.
When a trusted `@open-browser-use/sdk` is discoverable the kernel installs the
global `agent`. `await agent.browsers.get("chrome")` drives the user's real Chrome
through the WebExtension-backed, Playwright-shaped SDK (preserves cookies, tab
groups, visible state, and human takeover; fails fast instead of silently falling
back to CDP). `agent.browsers.get("cdp")` is an explicit lower-fidelity escape
hatch for when Chrome profile continuity is not required. Browser policy is enforced
locally by SDK guards and host policy (navigation, upload, download, history, raw
CDP, current-origin) before any backend side effect — there is no remote phone-home.
The native pipe is injected only into trusted SDK modules via
`import.meta.__obuNativePipe`, never the `js` cell, `globalThis`, or capability
tokens; `browser_status` reports whether the SDK was trusted by path, by hash, or by
local `trust_all`.

## Always / Never

**Always:** run `browser_status` first if readiness is uncertain · keep `browser`
and `tab` on `globalThis` and reuse them across cells · call `browser.name("…")`
early so Chrome tab groups stay attributable · create the first task tab with the
target URL when the first page is known · `await tab.attach()` before acting ·
prefer semantic locators (`getByRole`/`getByLabel`) and `tab.goto(url)` over opening
new tabs · reuse the last snapshot until navigation, a modal/dropdown, a timeout, a
strict-match failure, or a parse failure means the UI changed · batch reads
(`locator.all()`, one `tab.evaluate(...)`) instead of per-element
`getAttribute`/`innerText` loops · read `structuredContent`, not the text summary.

**Never:** open a new browser or tab per cell · create or attach an intermediate
`about:blank` tab as a bootstrap step when the task has a target URL · brute-force undocumented URLs or
query-param grids (try one alternative, then navigate visibly or report the best
result) · re-verify a fact an authoritative signal already gave (success toast, cart
line item, selected/checked state, URL parameter) · use raw CDP when
`browser.viewport` or `browser.visibility` exists · drive `file://` pages (serve over
HTTP, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:…`).

## Bootstrap

Keep persistent handles on `globalThis` so later cells continue the same visible
task instead of opening a new tab. If the task has a known first page, create the
first task tab with the target URL in the same bootstrap cell. Do not create or
attach an intermediate `about:blank` tab and then navigate away from it:

```js
if (!globalThis.browser) globalThis.browser = await agent.browsers.get("chrome");
await browser.name("short task label");
const startUrl = "https://example.com"; // replace with the first page for this task
if (typeof tab === "undefined")
  globalThis.tab = (await browser.tabs.current()) ?? (await browser.tabs.create(startUrl));
await tab.attach();
```

`browser.tabs.create()` accepts a URL string or `{ url }`. Calling it without a URL
intentionally opens `about:blank` for rare blank-canvas workflows; it is not the
recommended bootstrap path.
`browser.tabs.current()` continues the active task; `browser.tabs.selected()` is
browser-visible discovery — if it returns a user tab reference, claim/resume it
before acting. One session can hold several named `Tab` handles; move data between
them explicitly.

## Observing the page

Observation is open — you choose what to read and how deeply; the environment does not
pre-digest the page. Orient with one broad read (a fresh `tab.domSnapshot()`, or
`tab.screenshotForModel(...)` when layout matters more than the DOM — not both), then
narrow to the relevant container or a few candidates. Don't re-dump a full snapshot
every cell, and don't loop per-element reads (`getAttribute`/`innerText`) as a search —
parse one `domSnapshot()` instead. `tab.snapshotText()` is a capped affordance summary
(~20 items/category) of clickable/typable chrome — NOT page content (it carries no prose).
Its `interactables[]` entries expose role/name/tag/type/href plus enabled/visible flags
and, when available, `locatorHint.expression` plus `locatorRecipes[]` with
`matchCount`/`unique`/`ambiguity` evidence. Prefer a unique hint/recipe before acting;
ambiguous hints mean you should scope to a container or inspect a stronger attribute
instead of repeating the same broad locator. Use `.first()` / `.nth(i)` only after
`count()` or scoped evidence shows why that index is the intended target. On dense,
result-grid, or SPA pages prefer `domSnapshot()` for the full page, or run your own
`tab.evaluate(...)` query for a scoped slice. It
self-describes its compaction —
`result.meta.truncated` plus per-category `meta.categories.{links,headings,interactables,...}.{shown,total}`
— so branch on `meta.truncated` to decide whether to go to `domSnapshot()`/`evaluate()`
rather than trusting the capped list as complete.

`tab.observe()` is the lifecycle/ownership/action-family envelope around a read — reach for
it when you need ownership/commandable/section-status signals, not for raw content (it
embeds the same capped `text` summary). If `observe().ownership.state === "lost"` the tab
handle predates a browser-control lifecycle change (host restart / handoff): re-acquire it
(`browser.tabs.current()` / `resumeControl()`, or just `await tab.attach()`) before
observation-bound actions — your open-action-space reads (`evaluate`, locators) still work.

`tab.goto(...)` resolves at `load`, which on SPA/app-shell pages can precede content
render. If a read is empty or sparse on a page you expect to have content, settle then
re-read (`await tab.waitForContentSettle()` waits for the DOM to stop changing, bounded)
before concluding it's empty — it's usually still hydrating.

## Acting on the page

Pick the verb directly instead of round-tripping through `help()`:

| Intent | Call |
|---|---|
| read the page (full fidelity) | `tab.domSnapshot()` — the complete DOM; parse what you need |
| affordance summary (capped) | `tab.snapshotText()` — clickable/typable chrome, ~20/category, no prose; inspect `interactables[]` and check `result.meta.truncated` |
| compact interactable node list | `tab.dom_cua.text()` (ids stay valid for `dom_cua` actions) |
| find an element (preferred) | `tab.getByRole(...)` / `getByLabel(...)` / `getByText(...)` |
| click / type / fill / press | `locator.click()` / `.type()` / `.fill()` / `.press()` |
| select / check | `locator.selectOption(...)` / `.check()` / `.setChecked(...)` |
| act with no usable locator | `tab.dom_cua.click(node_id)`, else `tab.cua.click(x, y)` |
| save image / video / audio | `download_media` on `locator` / `tab.dom_cua` / `tab.cua` |
| page-triggered download / file picker | `tab.waitForEvent("download")` / `waitForEvent("filechooser")`, armed before the click |
| decide *where* to act | `tab.screenshotForModel({ clip })`, then act via a verb above |
| bulk extraction | one `tab.evaluate(...)` or `locator.all()`, not per-element loops |
| end / pause the turn | `browser.turnEnded()`, or `browser.yieldControl()` → `resumeControl()` |

`help()` prints the full SDK API table.

Locator priority ladder (most to least robust — prefer the highest that uniquely
matches):
1. Role + accessible name: `tab.getByRole("button", { name })`, `tab.getByLabel(...)`,
   and the other `getBy*` accessible locators. Most resilient to markup churn.
2. Visible text: locate by the text the user actually sees.
3. Stable test ids or unique attributes the page author intends as hooks.
4. Structural CSS via `tab.locator("css")` — brittle; use only when no semantic
   locator disambiguates, and keep selectors shallow.
5. Coordinate or visual targeting (the modality ladder below) — only when no stable
   DOM locator exists.

When a broad locator is ambiguous, do not retry the same selector and do not use
`.first()` / `.nth(i)` as a guess. Use `.first()` / `.nth(i)` only after you have
evidence from `await locator.count()`, `snapshotText().interactables[].locatorHint.matchCount`,
or a scoped container read showing why that index is the intended target. Prefer a
unique `locatorHint` / `locatorRecipes[]` entry, a role/name locator,
`.filter({ visible: true })`, or a container scope before ordinal selection. If
`snapshotText().meta.truncated` is true, inspect `snapshotText().interactables`,
`tab.affordances()`, or a scoped `domSnapshot()` before acting.

Modality preference ladder (prefer the highest-fidelity modality that can act on
the target):
1. Playwright locators (`tab.getByRole`/`getByLabel`/`locator(...)`) — default for
   anything addressable in the DOM.
2. DOM-CUA (`tab.dom_cua`): click/type by snapshot node id when locators cannot
   target the element but it still exists as a DOM node. Use `tab.dom_cua.text()` to
   read the node list while keeping ids valid. The default (json) read self-describes via
   `meta.{shown,total,truncated,degraded}` (plus per-entry `text_truncated` for labels
   clipped at 240 chars); `text()` appends a one-line truncation marker. Branch on
   `meta.truncated` / `meta.degraded` to fall back to `domSnapshot()`/`evaluate()` rather
   than trusting the node list as complete.
3. Coordinate-CUA (`tab.cua`): act by viewport coordinates when DOM targeting fails
   but the element is visibly rendered (canvas, custom widgets).
4. Vision (`tab.screenshotForModel(...)`): use a clipped screenshot to *decide where*
   to act, then act through the highest modality above that can reach the target.
   Vision locates; it does not click.

## Recovery

When an action fails, match the signal and act; do not blindly retry:

| Failure signal | Meaning | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `error.data.resolution === "occluded"` | another element covers the target | scroll/dismiss the overlay, target a different element, or pass `force: true` to bypass the hit-test |
| `error.data.resolution === "outside_viewport"` | target is off-screen | scroll it into view, then retry |
| `error.data.resolution === "no_clickable_box"` | target has no visible box | pick a different element |
| `error.data.resolution === "not_visible"` | element exists but isn't actionable yet (the `state` field says which: `visible`/`stable`/`enabled`/`editable`) — e.g. animating in, just mounted, hidden, or disabled | if it should still appear/settle, `await tab.waitForContentSettle()` (or re-observe) then retry; for transient UI (autocomplete/dropdown/dialog) open and act in the **same** cell; if genuinely hidden/disabled, target a different element |
| `error.data.resolution === "detached"` | the matched node was removed/replaced (e.g. a re-render) | re-acquire the locator and re-read the page before retrying — don't reuse a stale node |
| `ObuError.code === -1203` (`error.data.code === "dialog_requires_decision"`) | a native `confirm`/`prompt` was dismissed and the op failed | resolve the dialog's intent another way, then retry |
| timeout, then `reconcile_state === "timed_out_pending_reconcile"` | the extension request may still land late | re-observe page/tab state (snapshot or a cheap locator read) before retrying, so a late success is not duplicated |

Native `alert` and `beforeunload` dialogs on controlled tabs are auto-accepted; only
`confirm`/`prompt` fail as above.

## Safety & confirmations

- Handoff-required: payment submission, account deletion, irreversible purchase,
  permission grants, or actions that expose private account data. Use
  `browser.yieldControl()` and let the human complete the step.
- Action-time confirmation: downloads, uploads, file chooser selection, browser
  history reads, raw CDP, and cross-site navigation when local policy requires a
  decision. Ask immediately before the action and surface stable `ObuError` product
  codes if blocked.
- Preapproval-acceptable: repetitive same-site navigation, filtering, sorting,
  pagination, and form edits the user already requested for the active task. Keep the
  same tab state and continue without repeated confirmations.
- No-confirmation: reading visible page content, DOM snapshots, locator counts,
  screenshots for inspection, cursor movement, and waits that do not mutate state.

Turn lifecycle: `browser.turnEnded()` ends a turn while keeping active tabs
controlled — use it for setup/readiness probes and between same-task cells.
`browser.finishTurn({ keep: [] })` finalizes first (closing agent-created tabs or
releasing user-claimed tabs), so reserve it for intentional cleanup. For human
takeover, `await browser.yieldControl()`, then
`globalThis.tab = await browser.resumeControl()` before resuming actions.

## Arguments

- `source` — JavaScript source to execute.
- `timeout_ms` — optional execution timeout in milliseconds. On timeout the current
  Node child is killed and the next `js` call starts a fresh child.

## Result

Field shapes are defined in the tool's `outputSchema`; the MCP text `content` is only
a short status summary — read `structuredContent` for the actual data. Key fields:

- `stdout` — captured `console.*` and `nodeRepl.write` output.
- `result` — JSON-serializable value of the last expression, or `null`.
- `duration_ms` — kernel-measured execution time.
- `truncated` — per-field budget flags (`stdout`/`stderr`/`result`/`displays`).
- `displays` — frames emitted by `display(value)`, capped at the first 50 (head).
- `displays_total` / `displays_shown` — total frames emitted vs. how many are in
  `displays`. When `displays_total > displays_shown` the first 50 were kept,
  `truncated.displays` is set, and the status summary reads e.g.
  `Truncated: displays (50 of 4321 shown; head).`
- `artifacts` — MCP resource summaries for large payloads spilled out of the result.
- `response_meta` — metadata set with `nodeRepl.setResponseMeta(value)`.
- `error` — user-code error message when the cell fails, otherwise `null`. JavaScript
  errors are tool results with `isError: true`; invalid MCP arguments, timeouts, and
  kernel transport failures are protocol errors.
- `error_detail` — structured detail when available, including the SDK `ObuError`
  `code` and `data` (and product-error `code`). Branch on these stable codes instead
  of matching `error` message text.

## Globals

- `display(value)` — show progress. Strings and JSON-compatible values stream live
  via MCP `notifications/progress` when the client provides a progress token, and are
  also returned in `displays`. SDK `Image` values from `tab.screenshot()` or
  `locator.screenshot()` become image artifacts; raw `{ __obuImage: true, mime_type,
  data }` payloads are stored as MCP resource links instead of inline base64.
- `nodeRepl.cwd` / `nodeRepl.homeDir` / `nodeRepl.tmpDir` — working, home, and scratch
  directories.
- `nodeRepl.requestMeta` — per-request metadata supplied by the MCP client.
- `nodeRepl.setResponseMeta(value)` — attach response metadata.
- `nodeRepl.write(string)` — append low-level text output; prefer `display` for
  user-facing progress.
- `process` and `node:process` are intentionally unavailable to user code. Filesystem
  reads are allowed for imports and inspection; writes are blocked by Node's
  permission model unless the host launch explicitly allows them.
- `obuRepl.discoverBackends()` / `obuRepl.discoverBackendDiagnostics()` — trusted SDK
  backend inventory (seeded from `OBU_BACKENDS`) and ignored runtime-descriptor
  reasons, useful when browser setup is not discoverable.
- `agent` — installed when a trusted `@open-browser-use/sdk` is discoverable; use
  `await agent.browsers.get(kind)` to connect lazily.
- `help()` — prints the full SDK API table.

Reading page console output: use `await tab.dev.logs()` to install and read a
small page-side console buffer. The first call installs the buffer for subsequent
`console.*` calls in the current page; call it once before the action you want to
debug, then call it again after the action. Use `{ clear: true }` when you want
to drain the buffer, and keep `maxEntries` small. Use `tab.dev.cdp(...)` only
when you need direct CDP protocol access.

## Token budget

Keep `stdout`, final expression values, and `display()` payloads small. The MCP server
caps large text/JSON fields and spills image-like base64 to resources, but concise
summaries are still best. Prefer `tab.domSnapshot()`, `tab.snapshotText()`,
`tab.evaluate(...)`, `display(await tab.screenshot(...))`, and
`tab.screenshotForModel(...)` over raw CDP evaluation or raw screenshot returns.
Text/JSON `display()` frames stream as progress but are also included in the result.

## Examples

First cell — the template (bootstrap → name → attach → act → end):

```js
if (!globalThis.browser) globalThis.browser = await agent.browsers.get("chrome");
await browser.name("Docs check");
if (typeof tab === "undefined")
  globalThis.tab = (await browser.tabs.current()) ?? (await browser.tabs.create("https://example.com"));
await tab.attach();
await tab.goto("https://example.com/docs");
await tab.getByRole("link", { name: "API reference" }).click();
await browser.turnEnded();
```

Continue in a later cell — reuse the persisted handles; `turnEnded()` kept control,
so there is no re-bootstrap and no re-attach:

```js
await tab.getByRole("link", { name: "Examples" }).click();
display(await tab.locator("h1").innerText());
await browser.turnEnded();
```

Fall down the modality ladder — locator first; if nothing semantic matches, use
DOM-CUA off the snapshot node list:

```js
const save = tab.getByRole("button", { name: "Save" });
if (await save.count()) {
  await save.click();
} else {
  display(await tab.dom_cua.text());          // compact node list with ids
  // then act on an id from the list, e.g. await tab.dom_cua.click("<id>")
}
await browser.turnEnded();
```

Sensitive step — hand control to the human, then resume:

```js
await browser.yieldControl();                  // payment / login / irreversible action
globalThis.tab = await browser.resumeControl();
await tab.goto("https://example.com/account/orders");
await browser.turnEnded();
```

Non-browser — the kernel is general-purpose JavaScript:

```js
display("checking package metadata");
const pkg = await import("./package.json", { with: { type: "json" } });
pkg.default.version;
```

Use `js_add_module_dir({ path })` before importing packages from an additional
absolute directory; it is added to the kernel's bare-module import roots and is
re-applied when the kernel respawns.
