# open-browser-use P4 Release Checklist

P4a supports macOS and Linux only. Do not publish Windows npm packages or curl
targets until a dedicated Windows runtime milestone is complete.

## Release Stance

Current stance: preview.

- Public npm scope/package access for `@open-browser-use/*` is not verified here.
- Curl-style preview installs use GitHub Release assets, not a dedicated
  website URL.
- Docs and smoke tests must use local tarballs or GitHub Release artifacts until
  npm publication is verified.
- Planned GitHub Release repository name: `open-browser-use`.

## Build

Pinned Node runtime for P4a: Node.js `v22.22.0`.

The musl archive is Node-hosted but comes from `unofficial-builds.nodejs.org`;
verify that this source is acceptable before public publish.

Fetch a pinned Node runtime root:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-node-runtime.mjs --target current
node scripts/fetch-node-runtime.mjs --target linux-x64-musl
```

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r test
pnpm -r build
cargo test -p obu-wire -p obu-node-repl -p obu-host --lib --tests --no-fail-fast
```

Verify the pinned cargo-dist release plan:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/releases/download/v0.31.0/cargo-dist-installer.sh | \
  CARGO_DIST_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1 CARGO_HOME="$PWD/.cache/cargo-dist-home" sh
CARGO_DIST_BIN="$PWD/.cache/cargo-dist-home/bin/cargo-dist" \
  node scripts/cargo-dist-smoke.mjs
node scripts/p4-release-readiness-smoke.mjs
```

The P4 packaging CI includes a `p4-target-payloads` matrix for the five P4a
targets. Each matrix leg builds release-mode target Rust binaries, fetches the
pinned Node runtime for that target, assembles a payload, runs
`payload-self-check`, stages the matching npm package, and runs static
package/tarball checks. Runner-native targets also run dynamic npm and curl
install smokes. Every matrix leg uploads the generated
`open-browser-use-<version>-<target>.tar.gz`, `.sha256`, `install.sh`, and
manifest as a GitHub Actions artifact for GitHub Release promotion.

Assemble the current-platform preview payload:

```bash
node scripts/assemble-payload.mjs --node-root /path/to/node-22.22-or-newer
node scripts/payload-self-check.mjs --payload dist/payload/current
```

`--allow-current-node` is for local smoke payloads only. Release payloads must
use a full Node 22.x distribution at or above `22.22.0`.
For non-current P4a targets, pass `--target <p4a-target> --host-bin
</path/to/obu-host> --node-repl-bin </path/to/obu-node-repl>` with binaries
built for that target; the assembler refuses cross-target payloads unless both
Rust binaries are explicit.
`stage-npm-packages.mjs` and `make-curl-artifact.mjs` accept repeated
`--payload <dir>` inputs, or `--payload-root <dir>` to scan immediate child
payload directories, and attach each payload/artifact to the target from its
`metadata.targetTriple`.

## npm Preview Packages

```bash
node scripts/stage-npm-packages.mjs --payload dist/payload/current
node scripts/npm-wrapper-resolver-smoke.mjs
node scripts/package-local-smoke.mjs --target all --static --expect-payload current
node scripts/npm-pack-smoke.mjs --target current
```

Verify:

- staged `@open-browser-use/cli` has no `engines.node >=22.22.0`;
- staged `@open-browser-use/cli` only contains `bin/obu` and wrapper metadata;
- platform package contains the full payload;
- platform package bundles `@open-browser-use/sdk` and `jsonc-parser`;
- no Windows platform package exists.
- `obu repl` exits with the P4a deferred-command message until a direct debug
  REPL contract is implemented and tested.

NPM publish order for a production release:

1. Publish all platform payload packages first:
   `@open-browser-use/cli-darwin-arm64`, `@open-browser-use/cli-darwin-x64`,
   `@open-browser-use/cli-linux-x64-gnu`, `@open-browser-use/cli-linux-x64-musl`, and
   `@open-browser-use/cli-linux-arm64-gnu`.
2. Verify each platform package appears on npm with the expected version and
   tarball checksum.
3. Publish the wrapper package `@open-browser-use/cli` last, after all optional dependency
   targets are available.
4. Install `@open-browser-use/cli` from npm in a fresh temp prefix with optional
   dependencies enabled and run the npm tarball smoke against that install.
5. Do not publish any Windows package in P4a.

## curl Preview Artifact

```bash
node scripts/make-curl-artifact.mjs
sh -n scripts/install.sh
node scripts/install-refresh-safety-smoke.mjs
node scripts/curl-install-smoke.mjs
node scripts/setup-local-spine-smoke.mjs
```

Verify installer support for:

- checksum verification;
- clean-prefix setup spine reaching `obu verify` `ready` for one Codex handoff;
- manifest-driven current-platform selection through `OBU_RELEASE_BASE_URL`,
  preferring `manifest.tsv` and falling back to `manifest.json`;
- `OBU_INSTALL_DIR`;
- `OBU_UNMANAGED_INSTALL`;
- `--no-modify-path`;
- stable `bin/obu` shim pointing at `payloads/current`;
- atomic refresh safety: failed extraction, invalid staged payloads, same-name
  activation failure, and `payloads/current` symlink-update failure preserve the
  previous working payload.
- release lifecycle metadata records payload version, extension channel/id,
  native-host manifest expectations, installer migration hook directory, and
  payload retention policy.
- installer migration hooks in `install-migrations.d` run before
  `payloads/current` switches, and migration failure restores the previous
  working payload.
- forced same-name reinstall preserves the installed release metadata.
- `OBU_PAYLOAD_RETENTION` pruning preserves the active payload and previous
  rollback payload.
- packaged `obu shellenv` output and installer Next steps without writing
  arbitrary current-`PATH` shims.
- packaged `obu doctor --json` payload integrity checks, `obu verify` readiness
  checks, and `obu mcp stdio` initialize/list-tools through the installed shim.
- installed-payload `obu setup --yes --skip-agents`,
  `obu setup --yes --agents=codex-cli --write-instructions`, persistent Codex
  instructions, synthetic activated WebExtension profile/descriptor evidence,
  and installed-payload `obu verify --agent=codex-cli ... --json` returning
  `result: "ready"` with `nextAction: null`, no legacy `nextActions`, SDK
  bootstrap available, and one usable MCP backend.

Payload metadata must include `extensionZip`, `extensionZipSha256`,
`extensionId`, and `extensionChannel`; `node scripts/payload-self-check.mjs`
verifies that the recorded extension zip checksum matches the staged file.
The root MIT `LICENSE` must ship in every payload. `LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY.md`
must include notices for the bundled Node.js runtime, `jsonc-parser`, and the
vendored Playwright InjectedScript, and the payload self-check must confirm
that both license files are present in every payload.

The generated curl release manifests are part of the installer contract. Before
uploading GitHub Release assets, verify `manifest.json`, `manifest.tsv`,
`install.sh`, every artifact tarball, and every `.sha256` file are present in
the same asset set.

For the fast path, promote a successful `P4 Packaging CI` run from `main` with
the release publish workflow instead of downloading and re-uploading artifacts
locally. The source run must be a `push` or `workflow_dispatch` run on `main`;
PR runs are not promotable:

```bash
gh workflow run release-publish.yml \
  -f version=<version> \
  -f run_id=<successful-p4-packaging-ci-run-id> \
  -f target_sha=<merge-commit-sha> \
  -f publish=true
```

The workflow downloads the five target curl artifacts and extension artifact
from the selected run, merges target manifests into the final release manifest,
validates checksums and sizes, uploads the draft release, verifies the asset set,
and publishes it when `publish=true`.

The workflow also attaches the standalone unpacked extension
`open-browser-use-extension.zip` (plus its `.sha256`) to the GitHub Release,
alongside the tarballs and `install.sh`. The `p4-packaging` CI job builds it
(via `node scripts/make-extension-artifact.mjs`) and uploads it as the
`open-browser-use-extension` workflow artifact; `release-publish.yml` downloads
that artifact and uploads it to the Release with the target payloads. The README
links it at the stable URL
`releases/latest/download/open-browser-use-extension.zip`, so keep that filename
stable across releases. It must be the unpacked-dev build (manifest `key`
present, id `fblnfcjnjklpgnmfnngcihbcgojnpadj`); `make-extension-artifact.mjs`
fails if the zip is a store-channel build, so the id stays fixed and the agent's
native-host wiring matches.

## Chrome Web Store Gate

Chrome Web Store release is a separate gate from the unpacked preview payload.
The Store item id must be final before public Store instructions are published.

Required draft checks:

1. Create a Chrome Web Store draft item.
2. For the first upload, build the Store artifact without a Store id. The upload
   manifest omits `key` because Chrome Web Store rejects that field:

   ```bash
   pnpm -C packages/extension build
   node packages/extension/scripts/build.mjs --channel store
   node scripts/make-extension-store-artifact.mjs
   ```

3. Upload the Store artifact and copy the item id from the Developer Dashboard.
4. Set `packages/extension/release-metadata.json` `store.storeExtensionId` to
   that id and `store.storeDraftVerified` to `true`.
5. Assemble GitHub Release payloads with the same id:

   ```bash
   node scripts/assemble-payload.mjs \
     --node-root /path/to/node-22.22-or-newer \
     --store-extension-id <STORE_EXTENSION_ID>
   ```

6. Rebuild and validate the Store upload artifact with the recorded Store id:

   ```bash
   pnpm -C packages/extension build
   node packages/extension/scripts/build.mjs --channel store
   node scripts/make-extension-store-artifact.mjs \
     --store-extension-id <STORE_EXTENSION_ID>
   ```

7. Run Store-channel bootstrap on a clean profile:

   ```bash
   obu bootstrap --yes --all --channel=store --extension-id <STORE_EXTENSION_ID> --agents=auto
   obu verify --agent=codex-cli --browser=chrome --channel=store --extension-id <STORE_EXTENSION_ID> --json
   ```

Verify:

- `~/.obu/config.json` records `extensionChannel: "store"` and
  `storeExtensionId`.
- native-host manifests include
  `chrome-extension://<STORE_EXTENSION_ID>/`.
- `verify --agent=codex-cli --browser=chrome --channel=store --extension-id
  <STORE_EXTENSION_ID> --json` reports the Store target and returns exactly one
  readiness result plus one next action when not ready.
- In a clean profile before popup activation, Store verify may return
  `needs_browser_popup` with `nextAction.kind: "open_popup"`; after the popup is
  connected, the same command should return `ready`.
- `doctor browser --channel=store --extension-id <STORE_EXTENSION_ID> --json`
  remains available as a lower-level diagnostic and reports `resume_required` on
  the runtime descriptor probe.
- the popup agent handoff preserves `Extension channel: store`, the exact Store
  extension id, and does not expose a Terminal command.
- the popup agent handoff links to the version-tagged
  `prompts/agent-install-prompt.md`, preserves the exact Store extension id, and
  explains the generic MCP stdio server contract before using OBU's adapter
  helpers. It asks the coding agent to make open-browser-use the primary
  BrowserUse/browser automation tool in the core `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent agent instructions when present.
- the popup still exposes `Copy for agent` after the native host is connected,
  so users can add another MCP client such as Cursor after Codex is working.
- `dist/chrome-web-store/chrome-web-store-artifact.json` lists only
  `manifest.json`, generated JS/CSS/HTML, the vendored browser-control-core
  runtime module, and icon files.
- permission justifications, data handling notes, and reviewer instructions are
  ready in [`chrome-web-store-review-pack.md`](chrome-web-store-review-pack.md).

## Manual Browser Gate

Run from a fresh temp home with Chrome or Chrome for Testing:

```bash
obu bootstrap --yes --all --agents=auto
obu verify --agent=codex-cli --browser=chrome --json
obu doctor --json
obu doctor --strict --json
```

Then load or reload the unpacked extension from:

```text
~/.obu/extension/current
```

The extension must publish a WebExtension runtime descriptor, and
`agent.browsers.get("chrome")` must complete a browser task.
The automated `setup-webext-e2e.mjs` path also wires a fake Codex CLI with
`obu setup --yes --agents=codex-cli --write-instructions` before launching
Chrome for Testing.
The exact dirty-form dialog fixtures can be run without the full ignored live
suites:

```bash
OBU_E2E_AUTO_INSTALL=1 pnpm smoke:cdp-dirty-form-live
OBU_WEBEXT_E2E_AUTO_INSTALL=1 OBU_WEBEXT_E2E_HEADLESS=1 pnpm smoke:webext-dirty-form-live
```

These remain live browser gates because they launch Chrome or Chrome for
Testing. The WebExtension gate also loads the extension, installs the
native-host manifest, and runs the ignored beforeunload fixture through the MCP
runtime.
`obu doctor --strict` must exit nonzero on warnings as well as failures; use the
non-strict command for interactive troubleshooting where warnings are advisory.
Before manual testing, enable extension popup Debug logs, reproduce one browser
task, copy the JSON report, and confirm it includes status changes plus
`native.request` / `host.request.ok` events. Clear logs after capture.

## Agent Gate

At minimum, test:

```bash
obu setup --yes --agents=codex-cli --write-instructions
obu setup --yes --agents=claude-code --write-instructions
obu setup --yes --agents=cursor
obu agent doctor --agent=codex-cli
```

For direct-edit adapters, rerun setup and confirm unchanged configs do not
create new backups.

MCP/browser-use compatibility gates:

```bash
pnpm smoke:mcp-client-compat
```

- `tools/list` shows `js`, `browser_status`, `js_reset`, and
  `js_add_module_dir`, and `initialize` advertises both tools and resources.
- `browser_status` returns SDK bootstrap state, discovered backends,
  diagnostics, runtime dir, a verify hint, and the legacy doctor hint alias
  without leaking descriptor auth tokens or capability tokens.
- A `display({ __obuImage: true, mime_type, data })` call returns a resource
  link, and `resources/read` fetches the artifact bytes.
- A huge `console.log` or huge final result stays bounded and sets the matching
  `structuredContent.truncated` flag.
- The `smoke:mcp-client-compat` client-profile smoke checks Codex CLI,
  Claude Code, and Cursor-shaped initialize/capability profiles for
  `tools/list` output schemas, `structuredContent`, concise text fallback,
  progress notifications, resource links/list/readback, and stdout/final-result
  truncation.
- Before a production release, repeat the same fixture through the real Codex CLI,
  Claude Code, and Cursor clients. The client-profile smoke protects wire shape;
  it is not proof that those production clients loaded and rendered the result
  paths correctly.

## Rollback

If a preview release is bad:

1. Stop publishing the wrapper package version first; the wrapper is the public
   entry point that pulls optional platform payload packages.
2. Deprecate the bad npm version with an explicit install message that points to
   the last known-good version.
3. Remove or replace the bad GitHub Release installer assets and update the
   release notes to mark the version withdrawn.
4. Repoint any preview install page or GitHub Release instructions to the last
   known-good artifact set.
5. Confirm a fresh temp-prefix install of the last known-good npm and curl
   artifacts still passes `obu --version`, `obu doctor --json`, and MCP
   initialize/list-tools.
6. Keep `~/.obu/extension/current` stable: rollback by reinstalling a prior
   extension payload into that path, not by asking users to load a versioned
   cache directory directly.
